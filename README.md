Check the examples in <WILL ADD LATER>.

2. How do I **debug** if I cannot use `sleep infinite`?

Solution 1: Debug on normal server and then deploy. 

Solution 2: Introduce debugging pods

IMPOSSIBLE for now! Or i should say, it's possible but you will not be happy to hear the solution.

4. How do I stop other people eating all the resources
